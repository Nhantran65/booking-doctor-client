## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have a fresh version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Yarn installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point.

1. Fork this repository and clone your own fork to your computer:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/1Byte-Software/vdt-community-fe.git
    ```

2. From the project's root directory, install the required packages (dependencies):

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. To run and test the app on your local machine (http://localhost:5173):

    ```sh
    yarn start:dev
    ```

    This will start a server instance and begin listening for connections in develop environment from localhost on port `5173`.

    ```sh
    yarn start:pro
    ```

    This will start a server instance and begin listening for connections in production environment from localhost on port `5173`.

4. To build/deploy the app, you can run:

    ```sh
    yarn build:dev
    ```

    This will place all files needed for deployment for develop server into the `/dist` directory.

    ```sh
    yarn build:pro
    ```

    This will place all files needed for deployment for production server into the `/dist` directory.
